  CSS의 C가 Cascading의 약자인데, 이는 상위 요소의 스타일 속성을 자손 요소들에게 상속시켜주는 모습이 DOM 트리구조에서 마치 폭포수처럼 내려가는 모습을 닮았기 때문이다.[1]</p>

A short story is a piece of prose fiction that typically can be read in one sitting and focuses on a self-contained

incident or series of linked incidents, with the intent of evoking a "single effect" or mood.

A dictionary definition is "an invented prose narrative shorter than a novel usually dealing with a few characters and

aiming at unity of effect and often concentrating on the creation of mood rather than plot."[1]

The short story is a crafted form in its own right. Short stories make use of plot, resonance, and other dynamic

components as in a novel, but typically to a lesser degree. While the short story is largely distinct from the novel

or novella (a shorter novel), authors generally draw from a common pool of literary techniques.
